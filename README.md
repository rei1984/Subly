# Subly Challenge

Built with React and react-bootstrap.

**TODO: The dates are not parsed into a date format or sorted by.**
**TODO: The image does not darken when hovered over. Cannot figure out the best way to do this.** 

I have never used react or typescript before this challenge althogh have had experience with JavaScript, HTML/CSS. To complete the challenege I completed a walkthrough of React and first completed the dashboard using JavaScript. Then afterwards I changed the project to use TypeScript.

Build folder contains a final build that can be run with the command: 

`npm run build`
`serve -s build`

when in the main subly-dashboard directory.
